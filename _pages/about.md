I am a bioinformatician and computational biologist with a background in molecular biology and genetics. I am interested in developing computational methods to analyze and interpret high-throughput biological data. My research focuses on the analysis of next-generation sequencing data. I am also interested in the development of machine learning methods for the analysis of biological data. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Oncology-Pathology](https://ki.se/en/onkpat) at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en). I am also a member of the [Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab)](https://www.scilifelab.se/).
