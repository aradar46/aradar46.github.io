I am a bioinformatician and computational biologist with a foundation in molecular biology and genetics. My primary focus is on developing computational approaches to analyze and interpret high-throughput biological data, with a particular emphasis on next-generation sequencing.

Besides my academic and research interests, I am passionate about working on small projects with various technologies. Before I embarked on my journey into programming, I have been involved in founding three startups, one of which, [Levva Pharma](https://levvapharma.com), is still operational and has been successful in medical device market.

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in the [Department of Oncology-Pathology](https://ki.se/en/onkpat) at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en) and am a member of the [Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab)](https://www.scilifelab.se/), where I work on innovative research projects that bridge biology and computation.
