I am a bioinformatician and computational biologist. I enjoy programming and working on small projects for fun. Here, in this blog, I will share my thoughts, projects, and experiences. Maybe you will find something interesting for yourself.

For those who will live thousands of years after me and magically find this blog, hey there! These are my version of drawings on the cave walls that people thousands of years ago before me used to do. Somebody was there, somebody is here, and I say hi to you, somebody who will be there!
