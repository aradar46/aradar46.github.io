A few days ago, I found myself reflecting on how I am spending my life. I came to the conclusion that most of it involves staring at screens. At the office, it’s a 34-inch screen; at home, it’s either a 50-inch or a 27-inch screen, and in between, it’s a 6-inch screen of my phone.

Realizing this, I thought, If I’m going to spend the time of my life anyway, why not make it more interesting?

So, I decided to create a list of small and light challenges for myself. These challenges should be easy enough to be feasible for me, and I’ll aim to complete as many as I can within a year. I’ll update this list as I go along.
