"You belong to me," whispers an enchanting, erotically charged voice repeatedly from behind. I want to turn around and see who it is, but I am paralyzed. The voice grows louder, "You belong to me," it echoes, transforming over time into a shout. It gets closer and louder until it is screaming right behind my neck, its breath hot against my skin, sending shivers down my spine. The words make me weep without the courage to confront the source. "You belong to me," I summon all my will to move and finally wake up with an erection. I know this dream intimately—its allure twisted with the terror it brings.
Gasping and frightened, I feel the cold cave air chill my sweat-drenched body. It seems to be daybreak; my heart stops and then starts to beat even faster. I know I cannot avoid what I have to do next: turn to look at the wall behind. With fear and trepidation, I stare at the southern stone wall of the cave. My breath catches as I spot the sole gap among the stones, and once again, the piercing, raging, furious red eyes of the beast stare back at me, as they have for as long as I can remember. We lock eye and my body goes rigid as a dead corpse.

Years ago, I ventured out from home into the woods, eager to see the world beyond my parents' shadow. It only took half a day for me to encounter the beast for the first time. Hearing it approach through the darkness of the bushes, I sensed the danger and ran, hearing it coming after me, roaring like a bloodthirsty bear. Out of breath and crying, I was ready to give up when I found the narrow cracks in the mountain wall and barely managed to squeeze through into a cave. Gasping for air, I looked back to see whether the beast was behind me, and it wasn’t. But suddenly, for the first time, I saw its rage-filled eyes right on the other side of the hole in the wall of the cave, looking at my slim, naive body and soul, signaling that I would be torn apart as soon as I went out.

For a few days, I waited in the cave, hoping the beast would leave the area. Yet, from time to time, it returned. 

Hunger and fatigue were my constant companions. In the cold, dark cave, I scavenged for food, finding nothing more substantial than lizards, insects, and bats—many bats and I was already feeling the darkness growing insude me. As months passed, the courage to even attempt an escape eluded me. However, I refused to live in fear, darkness, and filth. I told myself I am more than this. Resolving to be brave, I planned my escape from the beast. One day, I woke up early and waited for the beast to approach the hole and, as always, stare at me. After it left, I seized my chance. Rushing toward the cracks that had once welcomed my slender body into the cave, I was confronted with a harsh reality: the passage that had previously promised escape, now held me captive, its narrow confines no longer a match for my grown frame. I was a prisoner. 

I am a prisoner, looking into the beast's eyes again, I can see there is the same amount of rage in them as the fear within me. I am a prisoner of my own making, of my own fear, of my own cowardice. I am a prisoner of the beast, of the cave, of the darkness, of the filth, of the hunger, of the fear, of the rage, of the eyes, of the cracks, of the whispers, of the screams, of the dreams, of the nightmares, of the terror, of the courage, of the will, of the hope, of the despair, of the life, of the death.
