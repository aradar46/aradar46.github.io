Cooking a dish from a random country challenge ended up being Chicken Croquettes. I had never heard of this dish before, but I got a recipe from a Spanish friend, gave it a try, and it turned out to be super delicious! The following is the recipe polished by chatgpt.

#### **Preparation Time**
- **Chicken (traditional method):** 1 hour
- **Dough resting:** 2 hours

#### **Ingredients (Serves 2)**
- **Chicken:** 1 thigh and over-thigh (or leftover stew chicken)
- **Onion:** 1 medium
- **Wheat flour**
- **Butter or margarine**
- **Milk**
- **Nutmeg**
- **Sunflower oil** (for frying)

- **Eggs:** 1–2 (beaten)

#### **Required Tools**

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   - Boil the chicken thigh and over-thigh with vegetables (e.g., onion, carrot, potato) to make a flavorful broth.
   - Once cooked, shred the chicken into fine pieces.

2. **Cook the Onion:**
   - Dice the onion finely and sauté it with margarine or oil in a frying pan. Add salt to taste. Cook until golden.

3. **Combine Chicken & Onion:**
   - Add shredded chicken to the pan and sauté until well mixed and slightly golden.

4. **Start the Béchamel:**
   - Add a spoonful of butter to the chicken and onion mixture. Let it melt.
   - Sift in two tablespoons of flour, stir until browned.

5. **Make the Sauce:**
   - Gradually add milk while whisking continuously to create a smooth béchamel sauce. Ensure there are no lumps.
   - Season with nutmeg and stir until the consistency is like light mashed potatoes.

6. **Cool the Dough:**
   - Pour the mixture into a tray, spread evenly, and cover with plastic wrap.
   - Refrigerate for at least 2 hours to solidify.

7. **Shape the Croquettes:**
   - After resting, cut the dough into evenly sized squares. Shape each into an elongated ball with your hands.

8. **Prepare the Coating:**
   - Set up a breading station with three bowls: flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs/panko.
   - Coat each croquette in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.

9. **Fry the Croquettes:**
   - Heat enough oil to submerge the croquettes. Fry in small batches until golden brown.
   - Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.

10. **Serve & Enjoy:**
    - Serve the croquettes hot and crispy. Any leftover béchamel dough can be frozen for future use.

#### **Tips**
- Use leftover chicken from soups or stews for added flavor.
- Ensure croquettes are evenly sized for uniform frying.
- For best results, stick to frying; air fryers may alter the texture.
